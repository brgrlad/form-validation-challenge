My first challenge using Javascript, which I've been self-teaching myself for just over two months. This was a great oportunity for me to apply and learn more about the Regex tool as well pratice a bit more of event listeners and DOM manipulation. 

The form checks for two variants: empty inputs and incorrect e-mail format. In case the user fails to provide the right information, an error message is shown in the UI indicating what is wrong. If all fields are filled correctly, though, then a confirmation message is displayed.
